        <h3 id="tribute-info"> Here's how OG become a two-time TI champion </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Notail and Fly started the Dota 2 organization: OG</li>
          <li>Fly leave OG a month before TI8</li>
          <li>Notail heart was broken, but he didn't give up.</li>
          <li>He and Ceb re-organize the team from ground up.</li>
          <li>They found Topson, a pub star, and Ana, a man with few words.</li>
          <li>They had to play from the TI8 qualifier since they don't have enough DPC point.</li>
          <li>They made it to the TI8 and finally they won the agies.</li>
          <li>Many said it was a flute or a one time luck.</li>
          <li>They came back stronger at TI9.</li>
          <li>Ana IO was broken and feared by all teams.</li>
          <li>Final match of TI9 was Liquid VS OG</li>
          <li>They won the agies with 3-1 result.</li>
          <li>Now no one can say OG is a flute.</li>
          <li>They are two-time back-to-back TI champion.</li>
        </ul>
